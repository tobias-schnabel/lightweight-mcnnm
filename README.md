## What is lightweight-mcnnm

lightweight-mcnnm implements the MC-NNM estimator exactly as described in "Matrix Completion Methods for Causal Panel Data Models" by Susan Athey, Mohsen Bayati, Nikolay Doudchenko, Guido Imbens, and Khashayar Khosravi [(2021)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1891924). This estimator provides a powerful tool for estimating causal effects in panel data settings, particularly when dealing with complex treatment patterns and potential confounders.

The implementation focuses on performance and minimal dependencies, making it suitable for use in various environments, including GPUs and cloud clusters.

## Features

- Lightweight implementation with minimal dependencies
- Utilizes JAX for improved performance and GPU compatibility
- Faithful to the original MC-NNM algorithm as described in [Athey et al. (2021)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1891924)
- Suitable for large-scale panel data analysis
- Supports various treatment assignment mechanisms
- Includes unit-specific, time-specific, and unit-time specific covariates
- Offers flexible validation methods for parameter selection

## Installation

### Requirements

lightweight-mcnnm is compatible with Python 3.9 or later and depends on JAX and NumPy. Cuda-compatible versions of Jax are not currently supported directly by lightweight-mcnnm, but you can use JAX with CUDA support by installing it separately.

### Installing from PyPI

The simplest way to install lightweight-mcnnm and its dependencies is from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install lightweight-mcnnm
```

To upgrade lightweight-mcnnm to the latest version, use:
```bash
pip install --upgrade lightweight-mcnnm
```

#### JIT Compilation
By default, this package disables JAX's JIT compilation for better performance in typical use cases. If you want to re-enable JIT compilation, you can add the following line at the top of your script:

```python
jax.config.update('jax_disable_jit', False)
```

Note that enabling JIT may impact performance depending on your specific use case. I have found leaving JIT disabled to be the best option for most use cases.
## Using lightweight-mcnnm
1. Comprehensive example is available here: [![](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tobias-schnabel/mcnnm/blob/main/Example.ipynb)
2. Simple example of how to use lightweight-mcnnm:
```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from lightweight_mcnnm import estimate, generate_data

# Generate sample data
data, true_params = generate_data(nobs=500, nperiods=100, seed=42)

Y = jnp.array(data.pivot(index='unit', columns='period', values='y').values)
W = jnp.array(data.pivot(index='unit', columns='period', values='treat').values)

# Estimate the MC-NNM model
results = estimate(Y, W)

print(f"True effect: {true_params['treatment_effect']}, Estimated effect: {results.tau:.4f}")
```
For more detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to our documentation.

## Development

### Setting up the development environment

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To set up your development environment:

1. Ensure you have Poetry installed. If not, install it by following the instructions on the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lightweight-mcnnm.git
   cd lightweight-mcnnm
   ```
3. Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This command creates a virtual environment and installs all the necessary dependencies.
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```
Now you're ready to start developing!
### Testing and building the package
5. Running tests: use the following command:
    ```bash
    poetry run pytest
   ```
   This will run all the tests in the tests/ directory with the exception of test_estimation_options.py, which is meant to 
   exhaustively test possible combinations of estimation options and is disabled by default. To run all tests including
   this script, use the following command:
      ```bash
      poetry run pytest -m "not comprehensive or comprehensive"
      ```
   
6. Coverage: to generate a coverage report, run the following command:
    ```bash
    poetry run coverage report
    ```
    This will generate a coverage report showing the percentage of code covered by the tests.
6. Building the package: run the following command:
    ```bash
    poetry build
    ```
    This will create both wheel and source distributions in the dist/ directory.
