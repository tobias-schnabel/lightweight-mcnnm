    "# Covariates\n",
    "The `generate_data` function allows you to include three types of covariates in the generated dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unit-specific covariates (X):** These are characteristics or features that vary across units but remain constant over time. For example, in a study of students' academic performance, unit-specific covariates could include variables like gender, age, or socioeconomic status. These covariates capture the inherent differences between units that may influence the outcome variable.\n",
    "2. **Time-specific covariates (Z):** These are factors that change over time but are the same for all units at each time point. For instance, in an analysis of sales data, time-specific covariates could include variables like market trends, seasonal effects, or economic indicators. These covariates reflect the temporal variations that affect all units simultaneously.\n",
    "3. **Unit-time specific covariates (V):** These are covariates that vary both across units and over time. They capture the unique characteristics of each unit at each time point. For example, in a healthcare study, unit-time specific covariates could include individual patients' medical measurements or treatment adherence recorded at different time points. These covariates allow for capturing the dynamic and personalized aspects of each unit's experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three options are available for estimation, mirroring the description of the estimator in [Athey et al. (2021)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1891924).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `generate_data` function, you can control the inclusion of these covariates using the boolean flags X_cov, Z_cov, and V_cov. Setting these flags to True incorporates the respective type of covariates into the generated dataset, while setting them to False excludes them."
